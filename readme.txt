Hello world!

I could have never started thisjourney without writing that, you reading this must be pretty sick of seeing it, so I apologize. Well, my next assignment is to type in here a little bit and explain what I'm doing. I'm learning about branch creation, and that's what I've done just now: a new branch :)
